====================
metas.org revamps traditional STEM & STEAM  approaches applying math, engineering, technology, arts & science to everyday living.

Built in modules, metas.org 1.0 will focus on real world math and its application to financial empowerment. It is designed to make financial empowerment more efficient by incentivizing certain behaviors.  Currently pre-beta, metas.org is being built using open source software and open data. Suggestions or assistance with data integration are welcome.
